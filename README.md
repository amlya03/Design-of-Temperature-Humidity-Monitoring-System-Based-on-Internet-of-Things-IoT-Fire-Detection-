LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a mixture of various hydrocarbon elements derived from natural gas which has been added to pressure and the temperature is lowered so that it is in the form of a liquid. Leaks often result in fires in the room, which can cause fatal losses. Therefore, before an adverse fire event occurs, a fire extinguishing system is needed that quickly detects safe signs of fire, as well as early countermeasures against the potential for a fire that can automatically detect the trigger for this disaster and quickly detect signs of a fire. with the latest technology. Temperature & Humidity Monitoring System as a Fire Detection Alarm in an Internet of Things (IoT) based LPG Gas Warehouse.
